\section*{My Public Notes}
I was inspired to upload my notes on \href{https://github.com/arfs6/my_notes}{git} after deleting all my school notes. I then created a simple github action to convert the notes to HTML and make it available online. That is why this page exist.

All this is powered by \verb|latex|, \verb|git|, \verb|github| and \verb|make|.

\subsection*{How the notes are organized}
All the notes are inside directories (folders) that represents which category it belongs to. Each directory has an index file that briefly describe what kind of notes are in it, and a list of sub directories and notes in it.
